#### 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor
The project for homework one, was to take an existing website, clean up the CSS code and modify the HTML file to meet the clients criteria. The major points the criteria included were, meeting accessibility standards, semantic HTML elements, and a logical styling of the code.  

## Title
The screen shot below shows the title I thought was best to give the website to represent the company and breifly descripe what they do.

## ALT Attribute
The images in the HTML file did not have alternate text to meet accessibility standards. The screen shot below shows a few examples of alt attributes added to image elements to meet the accessibility standards criteria.

## Cleaning up the CSS Code
In the CSS file their were redundent blocks of code that I combined together, because the seperate blocks of code had the same effect on the HTML file. In the example shown below, I made the class benefits, which combined together the repeating CSS code into one block. Thus leaving the code cleaner than I found it.
