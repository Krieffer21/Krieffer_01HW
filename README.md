01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor
The project for homework one, was to take an existing website, clean up the HTML code and modify the CSS it to meet the clients criteria. The major points the criteria included were, meeting accessibility standards, semantic HTML elements, and a logical styling of the code.  

## Example 1- Title
The screen shot below shows the title I thought was best to give the website to represent the company and breifly descripe what they do.

## Example 2- ALT Attribute
The screen shot below shows a few of the alt attributes of the image elements, that I used to describe the image shown on the website to meet accessibility standards.

## Example 3- CSS
In the CSS file their were redundent blocks of code that I combined together because the seperate blocks  had the same effect on the HTML file. In the example shown in the code below, I made the class benefits, which combined together the repeating CSS code into one block. Thus leaving the code cleaner than I found it.
